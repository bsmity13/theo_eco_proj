# Theoretical Ecology Project

This repository contains all the code necessary to reproduce the model that I developed for BIOL 6270 -- Theoretical Ecology -- at Utah State University in Fall 2019.

## Script `proj_fun.R`
This script contains the functions that implement the simulations and plot the results.

## Script `test_scenarios.R`
This script contains the 4 scenarios used to test the expected behavior of the model prior to running the full suite of scenarios. See **Supplemental Information** in the draft manuscript (see below).

## Script `ms_scenarios.R`
This script contains the 10 main scenarios that make up the body of the manuscript. See the draft manuscript (details below).

## PDF `Research Paper Draft 1.pdf`
This is the first draft of the manuscript submitted for this assignment. It will undergo peer review and I will post a revised version here later. See this document for all the details about the motivation for these scenarios.
